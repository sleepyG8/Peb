# Peb
Documentation on Windows Process Environment Block

the "PEB" is where some process information is stored like debbugging status and the current base memory address of a proccess in memory. it is a critical part of Windows architecture as it works very close with the kernel. Theres is little to no documentation I have found to successfully get the base address of a function so here I have included a POC of getting the base address and the address of the peb itself.

Happy coding :)
